# Supporting code for Macedo-Lima et al., 2024 Current Biology

The code illustrated in this repository's [website](https://biomath.github.io/MacedoLima_CurBiol2024/) is read-only. For modifiable files, download .Rmd files

Raw data were preprocessed using our [MatLab](https://github.com/caraslab/caraslab-fiberphotometry) and [Python](https://github.com/caraslab/Caraslab_FP_preprocessing_pipeline) pipelines

The workflow for most datasets in this project was:

1. Raw data collection with MatLab (ePsych) and Intan/Synapse software

2. Data preprocessing with [MatLab pipeline](https://github.com/caraslab/caraslab-fiberphotometry)

3. Data preprocessing and plotting with [Python pipeline](https://github.com/caraslab/Caraslab_FP_preprocessing_pipeline)

4. Data analysis and plotting with R pipeline (current repository)
